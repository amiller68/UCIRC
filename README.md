This was the output of my very early work with the UChicago InfraRed Camera (UCIRC) team.
The purpose of this team was to design, build, and help operate a cloud cover monitoring system to be placed on the Euso SPB2 Balloon.

This work represented early use of a C++ library to interface with our two cameras.

Further work was done by exposing the C++ API to python and then coordinating that with an NCurses panel.
That work is managed in Private version control I lost access to since thinking to document the work I did there ;)
